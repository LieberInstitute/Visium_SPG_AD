## Overview

Welcome to the `Visium_SPG_AD` project! This project involves several interactive websites, which are publicly accessible for you to browse and download.

We spatially resolved transcriptomics of the inferior temporal cortex (ITC) from postmortem human brain tissue to study local gene expression profiles of brain microenvironments associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) related neuropathology bearing abnormal protein aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta; Ab) and phosphorylated Tau (pTau). Using a total of 10 tissue samples from 3 donors with late-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 1 age-matched control (Br3874), we generated proteomic-based, spatially-resolved transcriptome-scale (SRT) maps of the human ITC in which the immunofluorescence staining of Ab and pTau was integrated into the complementary SRT data of the identical tissue sections. With Visium Spatial Proteogenomics ([Visium-SPG](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/spatial-proteogenomics)), we utilized a within-subjects design to study gene expression changes associated with spatially localized brain neuropathology across the 3 donors with AD (Br3854, Br3873, and Br3880). Here, using _BayesSpace_ to identify the gray-matter associated spots in a data-driven manner, we discovered statistically significant differentially expressed genes in the core (Ab spots) and peripheral (next_Ab spots) compartments of Ab-associated microenvironment in the gray matter of ITC. For more detailed information about study design and experimental results, please refer to our [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.04.20.537710). This work was performed by the [Keri Martinowich](https://www.libd.org/team/keri-martinowich-phd/), [Kristen Maynard](https://www.libd.org/team/kristen-maynard-phd/), and [Leonardo Collado-Torres](http://lcolladotor.github.io/) teams at the [Lieber Institute for Brain Development](libd.org) as well as [Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/)'s group from [JHBSPH's Biostatistics Department](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics). This project was done in collaboration with [10x Genomics](https://www.10xgenomics.com/).

This project involves the [LieberInstitute/Visium_SPG_AD](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/Visium_SPG_AD) GitHub repository.

## Study Design

<img src="http://research.libd.org/Visium_SPG_AD/img/study_overview.png" width="1000px" align="left" />

**Spatial transcriptomics combined with immunodetection of Ab and pTau in the human inferior temporal cortex (ITC)**. (**A**) Schematic of experimental design using Visium Spatial Proteogenomics (Visium-SPG) to investigate the impact of Ab and pTau aggregates on the local microenvironment transcriptome in the post-mortem human brain. Human ITC blocks were acquired from 3 donors with AD and 1 age-matched neurotypical control. Tissue blocks were cryosectioned at 10μm to obtain 2-3 replicates per donor and sections were collected onto individual capture arrays of a Visium spatial gene expression slide, yielding a total of 3 gene expression experiments. The entire slide (4 tissue sections) was stained and scanned using multispectral imaging methods to detect Ab and pTau immunofluorescence (IF) signals as well as autofluorescence. Following imaging, tissue sections were permeabilized and subjected to on-slide cDNA synthesis after which libraries were generated and sequenced. Transcriptomic data was aligned with the respective IF image data to generate gene expression maps of the local transcriptome with respect to Ab plaques and pTau elements, including neurofibrillary tangles. (**B**) High magnification images show Ab plaques (white triangles) and various neurofibrillary elements such as tangles (white arrowheads), neuropil threads (red arrowheads), and neuritic tau plaques (yellow arrowheads). Lipofuscin (cyan) was identified through spectral unmixing and pixels confounded with this autofluorescent signal were excluded from analysis, scale bar, 20μm. (**C**) ITC tissue block from Br3880 (left) and corresponding spotplots (right) from the Visium data show gene expression of _MOBP_ and _SNAP25_, which demarcates the border between gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), scale bar, 1mm. Color scale indicates spot-level gene expression in logcounts. (**D**) Image processing and quantification of Ab and pTau per Visium spot. Ab and pTau signals were thresholded in their single IF channels for segmentation against autofluorescence background, including lipofuscin. Thresholded Ab and pTau signals were aligned to the gene expression map of the same tissue section from Br3880 and quantified as the proportion of number of pixels per Visium spot, which is visualized in a spotplot, scale bar, 1mm.

## Data Access

We highly value open data sharing and believe that doing so accelerates science, as was the case between our [`HumanPilot`](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-00787-0) and the external [`BayesSpace`](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-021-00935-2) projects, documented [on this slide](https://speakerdeck.com/lcolladotor/hca-la-2022?slide=18).

### Processed Data

[`spatialLIBD`](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-022-08601-w) also allows you to access the data from this project as ready to use R objects. That is, a:

* [`SpatialExperiment`](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btac299) object for the Visium-SPG samples (n = 10)

You can use the [`zellkonverter`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/zellkonverter/) Bioconductor package to convert any of them into Python [`AnnData`](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) objects. If you browse our code, you can find examples of such conversions.

If you are unfamiliar with these tools, you might want to check the [LIBD rstats club](http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/#.Y4hWlOzMJUM) (check and search keywords on the [schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1is8dZSd0FZ9Qi1Zvq1uRhm-P1McnJRd_zxdAfCRoMfA/edit?usp=sharing)) videos and resources.

#### Installing spatialLIBD

Get the latest stable `R` release from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `spatialLIBD` from [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) with the following code:

```{r 'install', eval = FALSE}
## Install BiocManager in order to install Bioconductor packages properly
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}
## Check that you have a valid R/Bioconductor installation
BiocManager::valid()
## Now install spatialLIBD from Bioconductor
## (this version has been tested on macOS, winOS, linux)
BiocManager::install("spatialLIBD")
## If you need the development version from GitHub you can use the following:
# BiocManager::install("LieberInstitute/spatialLIBD")
## Note that this version might include changes that have not been tested
## properly on all operating systems.
```

### R objects

Using `spatialLIBD` you can access the spatialDLPFC
transcriptomics data from the 10x Genomics Visium platform. For example,
this is the code you can use to access the spatially-resolved data. For more
details, check the help file for `fetch_data()`.

As of August 23, 2023 the processed data includes spot-level deconvolution results generated using [`cell2location`](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-021-01139-4) with the six broad cell types from the [Mathys et al snRNA-seq dataset](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1195-2) in which they found AD associated gene expression changes. To access these results check the `colData(spe)` columns starting with the `c2l_` prefix.

```{r 'access_data', message=FALSE, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 9, eval = FALSE}
## Check that you have a recent version of spatialLIBD installed
stopifnot(packageVersion("spatialLIBD") >= "1.11.12")
## Download the spot-level data
