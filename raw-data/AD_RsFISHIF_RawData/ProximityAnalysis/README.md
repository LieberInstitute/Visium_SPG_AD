- GOI\_expressors: these are segmented cells that express a gene of interest. This folder stores the results of the HALO spatial/proximity analysis, which looked at the proximity of Abeta to cells with a specific gene of interest. The number of puncta was extracted from the corresponding FISH-IF dataset and assigned to the segmented cells using the FISH-IF dataset's matching Object_Id and Cell ID XXXX cells from the proximity dataset. The letter XXXX stands for the name of a gene of interest.
- Non-GOI\_expressors: these are segmented cells that do not express a gene of interest. This folder stores the results of the HALO spatial/proximity analysis, which looked at the proximity of Abeta to cells without a specific gene of interest. The number of puncta was 0, but still assigned to the segmented cells using the FISH-IF dataset's matching Object_Id and Cell ID XXXX cells from the proximity dataset. The letter XXXX stands for the name of a gene of interest.
