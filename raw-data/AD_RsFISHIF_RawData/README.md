- FISHIF_ObjectData: stores the results of the HALO FISH-IF module used to analyze the expression of Abeta and 6 genes of interest validated using RNAscope FISH-IF for each tissue section from 5 different AD donors. Simply put, this is the folder in which you can refer to the number of puncta for a specific gene in order to evaluate its gene expression. 
- ImageData: stores spectrally unmixed tiff images that have undergone HALO analysis.
- Manuals&glossary: contains two manuals provided by Indica Labs, a HALO manufacturer, for the FISH-IF and Proximity analysis. These clarify the definition of output parameters shown in the excel or .csv results of FISH-IF and proximity analysis.
- ProximityAnalysis: stores the results of the HALO spatial/proximity analysis module, which measures and analyzes the distance between two objects of interest, in this case, Abeta and gene-of-interest (GOI) expressors and/or non-expressors. 
- Settings: stores information about the parameters computed to run HALO for object segmentation and quantification of gene expression in the number of puncta.
