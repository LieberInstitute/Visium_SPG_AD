The following ITC (Inferior Temporal Cortex) tissue sections obtained from the following brain donors with IDs: Br3874 (control), Br3854 (AD), Br3873 (AD), Br3880 (AD), and Br8549 (AD). On each slide, one ITC tissue section from a given donor was collected and stained for Abeta and 3 genes of interest (GOIs and their transcripts) with the RNAscope FISH-IF (Rs-FISHIF) stanning method. A total of 6 GOIs were chosen and grouped into two combinations: 
- Combination 1: PPP3CA, UCHL1, and SST
- Combination 2: IDI1, NINJ1, and C3

Therefore, we have two slides where 5 tissue sections from 5 donors were stained for Abeta as well as one of the two combinations, per slide. 
- Rs-FISHIF_Combination1: PPP3CA, UCHL1, and SST 
- Rs-FISHIF_Combination2: IDI1, NINJ1, and C3

The 5 tissue sections are arranged in the following order in both slides.
